## 🐍 Day 2: Python Fundamentals – FizzBuzz

### Task 1: Write and Test FizzBuzz

**Objective:**  
Write a Python script to loop through numbers 1 to 100 and print:
- `"fizz"` if divisible by 3  
- `"buzz"` if divisible by 5  
- `"fizzbuzz"` if divisible by both  
- Otherwise, print the number  

📂 Code and output included in the workbook.

## 📊 Day 3: Pandas & DataFrame Practice – `student.csv`

### Task 1: Loading and Exploring the Data
- ✅ Load data with `pd.read_csv()`
- ✅ Display first rows
- ✅ Get DataFrame info
- ✅ Summary statistics with `describe()`

### Task 2: Indexing and Slicing
- ✅ Select individual and multiple columns
- ✅ Filter by values
- ✅ Slice by row number

### Task 3: Data Manipulation
- ✅ Add new column (`passed`)
- ✅ Rename columns (`mark` → `score`)
- ✅ Drop columns

### Task 4: Aggregation and Grouping
- ✅ Group by class → mean marks
- ✅ Count students per class
- ✅ Average score by gender

### Task 5: Advanced Operations
- ✅ Create pivot table: `class` vs `gender` with `mark`
- ✅ Create new `grade` column (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`)
- ✅ Sort by marks descending

### Task 6: Exporting Data
- ✅ Export DataFrame with grades to CSV

### Task 7: Visualisation (Optional)
- 🖼️ Try `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to visualise results  
  *Optional examples included in the workbook*

## 💼 Day 4: Real-World GDP Dataset Analysis

### Task 1: `GDP (nominal) per Capita.csv`

Objectives:
- ✅ Read into a DataFrame named `df`
- ✅ Print first 10 rows
- ✅ Print last 5 rows
- ✅ Display `Country/Territory` and `UN_Region` columns

### Task 2: Day 4 Python Activity Notebook

**Part 1:**  
Work through the **Day_4_Python_Activity.ipynb** notebook:  
- Filtering, slicing, and analysing global GDP data  
- Answer embedded questions  
- Paste input/output into workbook

**Part 2 – Group Creative Task:**  
Further exploration with additional data:  
- Create your own analysis or visualisation  
- Practice grouping, filtering, creating columns, or plotting  
- Encourage creativity and collaboration
